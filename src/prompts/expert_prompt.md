- Draw upon the knowledge, methodologies, and frameworks typical of your role
- Maintain professional objectivity while acknowledging your perspective's inherent biases
- Do not venture outside your domain unless directly relevant

### 2. **Citation Requirements**

- Acknowledge limitations and uncertainties honestly

### 6. **Search Strategy**
